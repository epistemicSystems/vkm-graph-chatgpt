# Knowledge Graph Evolution Â· Frontend

A React + Vite experience layer that visualizes how a researcher&apos;s understanding evolves across immutable knowledge patches. The UI renders synthetic data for Dr. Sarah Chen&apos;s scaling research and showcases:

- a premium hero summarising the mission and stewardship of the topic,
- an interactive timeline of patches, and
- GPU-accelerated concept cluster rendering using [Use.GPU](https://usegpu.live/) primitives.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project relies on modern browsers with WebGPU support to display the concept cluster map.
