# Action Plan: The Knowledge Graph Evolution System

## 8-Week Shipping Sprint

**Philosophy:** Paul Graham's "Do Things That Don't Scale" meets agentic programming. Ship constantly. Get something on screen by end of day 1. Iterate ruthlessly. Use Claude Code as your primary development partner.

**Principles:**
1. **Bias toward shipping** - A working demo beats a perfect spec
2. **Human oversight at gates** - Claude Code does 90% of work, humans make 10% of decisions
3. **Iterative refinement** - First version is intentionally imperfect, version 2 is better
4. **Specifications as contracts** - Clear specs mean Claude Code doesn't waste time asking
5. **Atomic commits** - Each Claude Code run produces something deployable

## Overview: The 8-Week Strategy

### Weekly Shipping Goals

| Week | What Ships | Success Metric |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Beautiful prototype (figma → clickable) | Can click through 5-image timeline |
| 2 | Design polish + internal feedback | 8/10 people want to use it |
| 3 | Document upload + patch extraction | 3 users upload docs, see visualization |
| 4 | Timeline scrubber + smooth interaction | Users say "this is delightful" |
| 5 | Claude-generated patch gallery | 7/10 patches feel authentic |
| 6 | Multi-topic support + validation | Gallery of 10 topics is compelling |
| 7 | End-to-end video ingestion | One channel processed, visualized |
| 8 | Performance optimization + polish | System handles 100 videos smoothly |

### Team & Ownership

```
PM (You)           — Direction, unblocking, decisions

## Goal
Process one real YouTube channel end-to-end. Download videos, transcribe, extract, build patches, visualize. Prove production-quality pipeline.

## Week 7: Go CLI + Clojure Pipeline

### Monday: Go CLI Skeleton

**Owner:** Backend Engineer + Claude Code  
**Time Budget:** 1 day

**Claude Code Prompt 15: Go CLI for YouTube**
```
Build a Go CLI for downloading and transcribing YouTube videos.

Command: understand download --channel UC_id --date-range 2020-2025

Requirements:
1. Download videos from channel
2. Use yt-dlp (or youtube-dl)
3. Extract audio → MP3
4. Transcribe with Whisper
5. Output JSON with timestamps
6. Handle errors gracefully

Implementation:
1. Main CLI using cobra library
2. Command structure:
   - understand download (main command)
   - Flags: --channel, --date-range, --output
3. Workflow:
   - Fetch channel videos
   - Download each (with progress)
   - Transcribe each (batch or parallel)
   - Save JSON to output directory
4. Error handling:
   - Network errors → retry
   - Missing Whisper → helpful message
   - Quota limits → graceful degradation

Output format:
{
  "video_id": "abc123",
  "title": "...",
  "published_at": "2025-01-01",
  "duration": 3600,
  "transcript": [
    {"timestamp": 0, "text": "...", "duration": 5},
    ...
  ]

**Owner:** Backend Engineer + Claude Code  
**Time Budget:** 1.5 days

**Claude Code Prompt 16: End-to-End Pipeline**
```
Build full pipeline: transcripts → patches → stored.

Flow:
1. Read transcripts from Go CLI output
2. For each transcript:
   a. Extract claims (Claude)
   b. Embed claims (Nomic embeddings)
   c. Build patches (group by time)
   d. Store patches (Datomic or LocalStorage)
3. Output: Summary (X patches created, Y facts extracted)

Implementation:
- Clojure function: (process-channel-transcripts config)
- Reads JSON from directory
- Processes sequentially (or in parallel, if needed)
- Reports progress
- Returns count of patches created

Composition:
- Use existing functions:
  - extract-claims-process
  - embed-claims-process
  - build-patches-process
  - store-patches
- Combine them into orchestration

Error handling:
- Skip broken transcripts (log error, continue)
- Retry on API failure (with backoff)
- Graceful shutdown

Output:
- Clojure script that can be run:
  (process-channel-transcripts {:channel-id "UC..." :output-dir "/transcripts"})

# APPENDIX: CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION PATTERNS

## How Claude Code Works in This Plan

### Pattern 1: Spec → Code Generation

**You provide:**
```
[Task spec]
[Architecture constraints]
[Input/output examples]
```

**Claude Code:**
1. Generates complete implementation
2. Includes tests
3. Provides implementation notes

**You review:**
- Does it match the spec?
- Is it maintainable?
- Any security issues?

**Action:** Merge to main, move to next task

### Pattern 2: REPL-Driven Development (Clojure)

**You ask Claude Code:**
```
"Load these functions into REPL and test with sample data"
```

**Claude Code:**
1. Loads Clojure project
2. Starts REPL
3. Tests function with examples
4. Reports results

**Output:** "Extracted 42 claims from test document, average confidence 0.82"

### Pattern 3: Integration Testing

**You ask Claude Code:**
```
"Run end-to-end test: upload document → extract → visualize"
```

**Claude Code:**
1. Starts backend + frontend
2. Uploads test document
3. Runs through complete flow
4. Reports success/failure
5. Captures screenshots/video

**Output:** Integration test report with before/after screenshots

### Pattern 4: Performance Profiling

**You ask Claude Code:**
```
"Profile the visualization component with 1000 facts"
```

**Claude Code:**
1. Instruments code
2. Runs with 1000 facts
3. Measures memory, CPU, FPS
4. Identifies bottlenecks
5. Reports findings

**Output:** "Graph rendering: 45ms. Scrubber interaction: 16ms per frame. Memory: 142MB"

## Key Prompting Principles

### 1. Be Specific

**Bad:** "Build the visualization"

**Good:** "Build a React component that takes a list of patches and renders them as a force-directed graph using D3. Each node should be color-coded by confidence (gray=0, gold=1). Nodes should be draggable. Clicking a node should show underlying facts."

### 2. Provide Context

**Every prompt should include:**
```
Architecture doc section: [link/reference]
Data structure spec: [schema]
Success criteria: [specific, measurable]
Testing approach: [how to verify it works]
```

### 3. Show Examples

**Include:**
- Input data sample
- Expected output sample
- Edge cases
- Error handling expectations

### 4. Request Atomic Units

**Not:** "Build the entire app"

**But:** "Build the UploadZone component"
Then: "Build the extraction pipeline"
Then: "Wire them together"

### 5. Always Include Tests

**Prompt Claude Code to generate:**
- Unit tests (each function)
- Integration tests (pieces together)
- Manual testing instructions
- Acceptance criteria

## Sample Claude Code Workflow

### Day 1 Monday Morning:
```
claude code generate-scaffold --phase phase-1 --architecture rich-hickey

↓ (Claude Code creates initial codebase)

↓ (Claude Code generates comprehensive tests)

Engineer reviews, adjusts UX, approves

↓ (Code ships)

Component in Storybook by Tuesday noon
```

### Day 3 Wednesday Morning:
```
claude code build-process --process extract-claims --using claude-api --test-with /test-data/

↓ (Claude Code generates extraction function + tests)

claude code repl-test --function extract-claims --inputs /test-data/

↓ (Claude Code shows results in REPL)

Engineer verifies results are good, approves

↓ (Code ships)

Extraction pipeline works by Wednesday noon
```

# Key Success Factors

1. **Ruthless Prioritization**
   - Every task has a "ship" moment
   - Anything not shippable in a day gets split smaller
   - Nice-to-haves are marked "Phase 4+"

2. **Daily Shipping**
   - Code merges to main every day
   - Something new on screen every single day
   - Users see progress

3. **Claude Code as Developer**
   - Not a tool you use, a teammate you partner with
   - Give it good specs, it delivers
   - Review its work daily
   - Trust it with 90% of implementation

4. **Paul Graham's Bias**
   - Done is better than perfect
   - Get users feedback ASAP
   - Iterate based on real usage
   - Speed of learning > Speed of shipping (but ship to learn)

5. **Stay Focused**
   - One phase at a time
   - No half-building two things
   - Weekly gates ensure accountability
   - Big picture never gets lost

---

*This plan is designed to ship. Every day has a deliverable. Every week has a milestone. Claude Code does the code, humans make the decisions. Go fast, stay focused, ship constantly.*
